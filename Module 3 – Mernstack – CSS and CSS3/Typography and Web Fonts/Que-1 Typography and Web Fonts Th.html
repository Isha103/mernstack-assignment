<!-- explanation of the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts:
 
Web-Safe Fonts:
Web-safe fonts are fonts that are pre-installed on most devices, including Windows and Mac computers, and mobile devices. These fonts are considered 
"safe" because they are widely available and will render correctly on most devices.

Examples of web-safe fonts include:

- Arial
- Calibri
- Courier
- Georgia
- Helvetica
- Times New Roman
- Verdana

Custom Web Fonts+:
Custom web fonts, on the other hand, are fonts that are not pre-installed on devices. These fonts are typically uploaded to a website or application,
and are loaded by the user's browser.

Examples of custom web fonts include:

- Google Fonts (e.g. Open Sans, Lato)
- Font Awesome
- Typekit fonts

Key Differences
Here are the key differences between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts:

- Availability: Web-safe fonts are pre-installed on most devices, while custom web fonts need to be uploaded and loaded by the user's browser.
- Rendering: Web-safe fonts will render correctly on most devices, while custom web fonts may not render correctly on older browsers or devices.
- Loading Time: Web-safe fonts are typically faster to load, since they are pre-installed on devices. Custom web fonts, on the other hand, need
 to be loaded by the user's browser, which can increase loading time.

Why Use a Web-Safe Font?
You might use a web-safe font over a custom font for several reasons:

- Faster Loading Time: Web-safe fonts are typically faster to load, since they are pre-installed on devices.
- Better Rendering: Web-safe fonts will render correctly on most devices, while custom web fonts may not render correctly on older browsers or devices.
- Wider Compatibility: Web-safe fonts are widely supported across different browsers and devices, while custom web fonts may not be supported on older browsers or devices.
- Simpler Implementation: Using a web-safe font is often simpler than using a custom web font, since you don't need to upload or load the font.
