<!-- What is CSS Specificity?
CSS specificity is a measure of how specific a CSS selector is. It's calculated based on the type of selector used, the number of selectors, and 
the order in which they appear.

How is CSS Specificity Calculated?
CSS specificity is calculated using a point system. Each type of selector is assigned a point value, and the total point value determines the 
specificity of the selector.

Here's a breakdown of the point values:

- *Universal selector (*)*: 0 points
- Element selector (p, div, etc.): 1 point
- Class selector (.class, .classes): 10 points
- ID selector (#id): 100 points
- Attribute selector ([attribute]): 10 points
- Pseudo-class selector (:hover, :active, etc.): 10 points
- Pseudo-element selector (::before, ::after, etc.): 1 point
