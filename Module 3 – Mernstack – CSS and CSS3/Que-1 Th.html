<!-- CSS Selectors & Styling -->

<!--  Que-1 What is a CSS selector? Provide examples of element, class, and ID selectors. -->

<!-- A CSS selector is a pattern used to select and style elements in an HTML document. It defines which elements the CSS rules apply to. There 
 re several types of CSS selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.
 
    1. Element Selector:
        p {
  color: blue;
}
    This will apply the styles (in this case, the text color being blue) to all <p> (paragraph) elements in the document.

    2. Class Selector
        .button {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
}
    This will apply the styles (red background and white text) to all elements that have the class button.
 
    3. ID Selector
        #header {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
    This will apply the styles (larger and bold text) to the element with the ID header.
