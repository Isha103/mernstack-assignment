<!-- Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox? -->

<!-- What is CSS Grid?
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex, grid-based layouts with ease. It's a powerful tool for building responsive and flexible user interfaces.

Key Features of CSS Grid
1. Grid Container: The element that contains the grid items.
2. Grid Items: The elements inside the grid container.
3. Grid Tracks: The horizontal and vertical lines that make up the grid.
4. Grid Cells: The individual cells created by the intersection of grid tracks.

How Does CSS Grid Differ from Flexbox?
1. Dimensionality: Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, while CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system.
2. Layout Structure: Flexbox is designed for linear layouts, while CSS Grid is designed for grid-based layouts.
3. Item Placement: Flexbox uses the justify-content and align-items properties to place items, while CSS Grid uses the grid-template-columns and
    grid-template-rows properties to define the grid structure.

When to Use CSS Grid Over Flexbox
1. Complex, Grid-Based Layouts: Use CSS Grid when you need to create complex, grid-based layouts with multiple rows and columns.
2. Two-Dimensional Layouts: Use CSS Grid when you need to create two-dimensional layouts that require precise control over item placement.
3. Responsive, Adaptive Layouts: Use CSS Grid when you need to create responsive, adaptive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and devices.

Example of CSS Grid Usage:
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #ccc;
  padding: 20px;
}


<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 6</div>
</div>


In this example, we define a grid container with three columns and two rows, and use the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties
to define the grid structure. We then place the grid items inside the grid container, and use the gap property to add space between the grid cells.
