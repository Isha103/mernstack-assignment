<!-- Describe the grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid- gap properties. Provide examples of how to use them. -->

<!-- 1. grid-template-columns Property
The grid-template-columns property is used to define the number and size of columns in a grid container.

Values:

- none: Indicates that there are no explicit grid tracks.
- auto: Indicates that the size of the grid track is determined by the content.
- length: Specifies a fixed length for the grid track.
- percentage: Specifies a percentage value for the grid track.
- repeat(): Specifies a repeated pattern of grid tracks.
- minmax(): Specifies a minimum and maximum size for the grid track.
- fr: Specifies a fractional unit that represents a proportion of the available space.

Example:


.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}


This example creates a grid container with three columns, each taking up an equal proportion of the available space.
