<!--  What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing in CSS? Which is the default?  -->

<!-- In CSS, the box-sizing property controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated, including the padding and border.
 
1. content-box (default):
This is the default value for the box-sizing property.

The width and height you specify for an element apply only to the content of the element.

Padding and borders are added to the specified width and height, making the total size of the element larger than what you set.

Formula:
Total width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border
Total height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border


2. border-box:
When using border-box, the width and height you set apply to the entire element, including its padding and border.

Padding and borders are included within the width and height, meaning they won't add to the total size of the element.

Formula:
Total width = width (this includes padding and border)
Total height = height (this includes padding and border)

Default:
The default value of box-sizing is content-box.

Example:
    /* content-box (default) */
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}

/* border-box */
div {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

In the first case (content-box), the total width of the div will be 200px + 20px + 20px + 5px + 5px = 250px.
In the second case (border-box), the total width remains 200px, and the padding and border are inside that width.
