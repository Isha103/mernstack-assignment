<!-- Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, margin). How does each affect the size of an element?  -->

    <!-- The CSS box model is a fundamental concept that defines how the dimensions of elements are calculated and how they interact with their
    surrounding elements. It consists of several components, each influencing the size and spacing of an element. Here's an explanation of the
    components:
    
    1. Content
    What it is: The actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other media.
    Size effect: The size of the content area is determined by the width and height properties of the element. The content is the innermost part of
    the box model and defines the basic area where the actual element content resides.
    
    
    2. Padding
    What it is: Padding is the space between the content and the border. It adds extra space inside the element around the content.
    Size effect: Padding increases the overall size of the element. For example, if you set padding to 10px on all sides of an element, the elementâ€™s
    total size will be increased by 10px on each side (left, right, top, and bottom).

    3. Border
    What it is: The border surrounds the padding (if any) and content. It can be styled with different colors, widths, and types (solid, dashed,
    etc.).
    Size effect: Borders also add to the element's total size. If you set a border width of 5px, this will increase the total width and height of 
    the element by 5px on all sides.
    
    4. Margin
    What it is: Margin is the space outside the border, which separates the element from other surrounding elements.
    Size effect: Margins don't affect the actual size of the element itself but impact how much space it takes up in relation to other elements. Margins 
    can create distance between the element and other elements on the page.
    
    Box Sizing:
    By default, the width and height properties in CSS only apply to the content area. However, if you use box-sizing: border-box;, the padding and
    border are included in the element's width and height, preventing them from expanding the overall size.
