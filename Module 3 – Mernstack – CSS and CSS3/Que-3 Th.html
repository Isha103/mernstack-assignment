the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. -->

<!-- 1. Internal CSS
    Advantages:
        Centralized within the document: You can keep all styles in one place within the HTML file, making it easy to manage for small websites or specific pages.
        No external files: Everything is contained in the HTML, so there's no need to worry about external file management or linking.
        Overrides external CSS: Internal CSS will override styles from an external stylesheet for that specific page, if needed.

    Disadvantages:
        Limited scope: Styles apply only to that particular page, which makes it less efficient for multi-page sites.
        Less scalable: If you need to apply the same styles across multiple pages, you would need to duplicate the styles on every page, which can become cumbersome.
        Performance issues: Each page will need its own internal styles, leading to code duplication and potentially slower page loading times.

    
    2. External CSS
    Advantages:
        Separation of concerns: HTML remains focused on structure, and CSS is contained in a separate file, making both easier to read, understand, and maintain.
        Reusability: You can link the same external CSS file to multiple HTML pages, allowing you to maintain consistent styles across an entire website.
        Performance: Browsers cache external CSS files, so once a file is downloaded, it doesn't need to be reloaded with every page request, improving loading time.
        Easier maintenance: Updates to the design can be made in one place (the CSS file) and automatically reflect across all pages that use that stylesheet.

    Disadvantages:
        Initial load delay: On the first page load, the browser needs to download the external CSS file, which could cause a delay in rendering the page.
        Dependency: If the external CSS file is not found or is broken, the page will load without styles, affecting the user experience.


    3. Inline CSS
    Advantages:
        Quick and specific: It’s useful for applying styles to individual elements directly within the HTML markup.
        No need for external files: You don't need to create a separate CSS file or block, making it quick for small, isolated style changes.
        High specificity: Inline styles have a higher specificity than styles in external or internal CSS, so they override other styles easily.

    Disadvantages:
        Harder to maintain: Applying styles directly to individual elements can lead to redundant code and make your HTML messy. Managing large styles this way is impractical.
        No reusability: Styles can't be reused across multiple elements or pages, making them inefficient for large websites.
        Code duplication: If you need to apply the same style to multiple elements, you'll have to repeat the inline style for each one, which can be inefficient.
        Overrides other styles: Inline CSS overrides other styles, even those in external or internal styles, which can lead to confusion and difficulty in debugging.


    When to Use Each Approach:
        Internal CSS: Ideal for single-page websites or when experimenting with styles for one specific page.
        External CSS: Best choice for large websites where you need to manage styles across multiple pages consistently.
        Inline CSS: Suitable for testing individual styles or very specific one-off adjustments on a single element, though it’s not recommended for large-scale use.
        In general, external CSS is the preferred approach for most web development because it keeps your HTML clean, makes your website easier to maintain, and allows
        you to reuse styles across multiple pages efficiently.
