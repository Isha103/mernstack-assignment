<!-- What is Flexbox?
Flexbox, short for Flexible Box, is a CSS layout model that enables you to create flexible and responsive layouts. It's based on the concept of a 
container (flex-container) that contains items (flex-items) that can be laid out in a flexible and efficient way.

Key Concepts:
1. Flex-Container: The element that contains the flex-items. You create a flex-container by setting display: flex or display: inline-flex on an element.
2. Flex-Items: The elements inside the flex-container. Flex-items can be any HTML element, and they will be laid out according to the flexbox rules.

Benefits of Flexbox:
1. Easy to use: Flexbox is relatively simple to learn and use, even for complex layouts.
2. Flexible: Flexbox allows you to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
3. Responsive: Flexbox makes it easy to create responsive layouts that work well on different devices and screen sizes.
4. Efficient: Flexbox reduces the need for complex CSS hacks and workarounds.

Common Flexbox Properties:
1. display: flex or display: inline-flex: Creates a flex-container.
2. flex-direction: Specifies the direction of the flex-items (e.g., row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse).
3. justify-content: Specifies how to distribute space between flex-items (e.g., flex-start, center, flex-end, space-between, space-around).
4. align-items: Specifies how to align flex-items vertically (e.g., flex-start, center, flex-end, baseline, stretch).
5. flex-wrap: Specifies whether flex-items should wrap to a new line (e.g., wrap, nowrap).
