<!--  What are media queries in CSS, and why are they important for responsive design? -->

<!-- Media queries are a fundamental concept in CSS that enable you to create responsive designs.

# What are Media Queries?
Media queries are a way to apply different styles based on various conditions, such as screen size, device orientation, or resolution. They allow
you to define specific styles for different media types, like screen, print, or speech.

# Why are Media Queries Important for Responsive Design?
Media queries are essential for responsive design because they enable you to:

1. Adapt to different screen sizes: Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on screen width, height, or aspect ratio.
2. Optimize for various devices: You can create specific styles for different devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers.
3. Improve user experience: By adapting your design to different screen sizes and devices, you can ensure that your website or application is easy to use and navigate.
4. Enhance accessibility: Media queries can help you create accessible designs that work well for users with different abilities and devices.

# Common Media Query Breakpoints
Here are some common media query breakpoints:

- max-width: 480px (mobile phones)
- max-width: 768px (tablets)
- max-width: 1024px (small desktop screens)
- max-width: 1280px (medium desktop screens)
- max-width: 1920px (large desktop screens) 

# Example Media Query

/* Apply styles for screens with a maximum width of 768px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for mobile devices */
  body {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
  header {
    height: 50px;
  }
}


In this example, the media query applies styles for screens with a maximum width of 768px, which is a common breakpoint for tablets. The styles 
defined within the media query will only be applied when the screen width is 768px or less.
