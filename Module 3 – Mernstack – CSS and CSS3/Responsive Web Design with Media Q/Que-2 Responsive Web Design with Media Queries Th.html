<!-- Write a basic media query that adjusts the font size of a webpage for screens smaller than 600px  -->

<!-- Here is a basic media query that adjusts the font size of a webpage for screens smaller than 600px:

# Media Query Code

/* Media query for screens smaller than 600px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Adjust font size for smaller screens */
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

# Explanation
- @media only screen and (max-width: 600px): This line defines the media query, specifying that the styles within the query should only be applied 
to screens with a maximum width of 600px.
- body { font-size: 14px; }: This line adjusts the font size of the webpage to 14px for screens smaller than 600px.

# Example Use Case
You can add this media query to your CSS file to ensure that your webpage's font size is adjusted for smaller screens, such as smartphones or tablets.

# Tips and Variations
- You can adjust the max-width value to target different screen sizes.
- You can add more styles within the media query to adjust other layout elements, such as margins, padding, or image sizes.
- You can use min-width instead of max-width to target larger screens.
