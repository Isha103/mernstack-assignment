<!-- Difference b/w HTML & HTML5?  -->

<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and 
Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which 
defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (at the note for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and
manipulate text accordingly. 

    Features of HTML:
    It allows the creation of hyperlinks with the <a> tag, connecting different web pages.
    Uses tags to mark elements and content, such as headings (<h1> to <h6>).
    It supports embedding images (<img>), videos (<video>), and audio (<audio>) for multimedia content.
    It provides form elements like <form>, <input>, and <button> for user input and data submission.
    Semantic tags like <article>, <section>, and <nav> for better document structure and accessibility.

interfaces(API) and Document Object Model(DOM). It has introduced various new features like drag and drop, geo-location services
