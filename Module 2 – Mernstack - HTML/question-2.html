Question-2.Theory Assignment
<!-- Explain the basic structure of an HTML document. Identify the mandatory tags and their purposes. 

    An HTML Hypertext Markup Language document has a basic structure that defines the content and organization of a web page. Here's a breakdown of the essential tags:

    1. <!DOCTYPE html>:
    This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML (in this case, HTML5). It is placed at the very beginning of the document.

    2. <html>:
    The <html> tag is the root element of an HTML document. All content of the page must be nested within this tag.

    3. <head>:
    The <head> tag contains metadata about the document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other meta-information. It doesn't display any content
    directly on the page.

    Mandatory tags inside <head>:

    <title>: Specifies the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.

    <meta>: Provides metadata like character encoding, author information, and other settings (e.g., <meta charset="UTF-8">).

    4. <body>:
    The <body> tag contains all the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and other elements. It's the main section that users interact with.
    Inside the body, various content tags are used to structure the page, such as <h1>, <p>, <a>, <img>, etc.
