<!--  Question 2: Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission. When should each be used?  
The GET and POST methods are two common HTTP methods used for submitting forms on the web. They differ in how they
send data and when each should be used:

GET Method

How it works: Data is appended to the URL as query parameters (in the form of key-value pairs) when the form is submitted.
Visibility of Data: Since the data is part of the URL, it is visible in the browser’s address bar.
Data Limit: GET has a size limit for the amount of data that can be sent (this limit varies by browser but is typically
around 2,000 characters).
Caching: GET requests can be cached, meaning browsers can store the result of the request and reuse it in the future.

When to use:

For retrieving data (like search queries or filters), where the data isn’t sensitive and can be publicly visible.
When bookmarking or sharing URLs with the same parameters is useful (e.g., search results).
When data size is small and doesn’t include sensitive information.

POST Method

How it works: Data is sent within the body of the HTTP request, not visible in the URL.
Visibility of Data: Data is not shown in the URL or the browser’s address bar, making it more secure for sensitive information.
Data Limit: POST doesn’t have a strict data limit, allowing it to send larger amounts of data.
Caching: POST requests are not cached by default.

When to use:

For sending sensitive data (like passwords or personal information), because it’s not exposed in the URL.
When submitting large amounts of data (e.g., file uploads or form submissions with a lot of data).
For actions that have side effects (e.g., creating or updating records in a database), since POST indicates that 
the server's state might change.
