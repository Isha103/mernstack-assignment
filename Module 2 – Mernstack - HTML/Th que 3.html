<!-- Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative?

Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because they are semantically intended for displaying tabular
data, not for structuring entire page layouts. Using tables for layout can lead to several issues:

   1. Accessibility: Screen readers and assistive technologies interpret tables as data structures, which can 
   confuse users when they are used for layout. This can negatively affect the experience for people with disabilities.

   2. Maintainability: Tables can become cumbersome to manage, especially as a page grows in complexity. Changes to
    the layout may require significant restructuring, making the code more difficult to maintain.

   3. Responsiveness: Tables are not very flexible when it comes to responsive design. Achieving a fluid, adaptive
    layout that works well across devices (like desktops, tablets, and smartphones) is harder when using tables for
    layout.

   4. Separation of Content and Presentation: Using tables for layout mixes content with its presentation, violating
    the principle of keeping HTML structure (content) separate from its styling (presentation). This goes against
    best practices for web development.

    
    Better Alternative: CSS Layout
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the modern and preferred method for creating page layouts. It provides a much
    more flexible and accessible way to arrange elements on a page. Here are some alternatives to using tables for
    layout:

    1.Flexbox: Flexbox allows for flexible layouts and alignment of elements, making it a powerful tool for creating
    complex layouts. It is especially useful for responsive designs.

    2.CSS Grid: CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for the creation of both rows and columns.
    It's great for more complex layouts and provides an easy way to create responsive designs without the need for
    floats or positioning.

    3.CSS Floats and Positioning: Although floats were traditionally used for layouts before Flexbox and Grid,
    they can still be useful for simple layouts, but they're often less intuitive than the newer techniques.

    4.Media Queries: Combine CSS layouts with media queries to make designs responsive, adapting to different4
    screen sizes and orientations.
