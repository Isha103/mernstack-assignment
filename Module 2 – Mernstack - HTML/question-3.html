What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples of each.

In HTML, elements are categorized into two primary types based on how they are displayed in the browser: block-level elements and inline elements.

    1. Block-level Elements
    Definition: Block-level elements occupy the full width available, starting on a new line, and extend to the left and right edges of their container
    (unless otherwise specified with CSS). They create a "block" of content.

    Characteristics:
    They always start on a new line.
    They can have width and height properties.
    They can contain other block-level or inline elements.

    Examples of Block-level Elements:

        <div>

        <p>

        <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>

        <section>

        <article>

        <header>

        <footer>
    
    
    2.Definition: Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line. They flow along with the content, appearing on the same line 
    as surrounding text or elements.

    Characteristics:
    They do not start on a new line.
    They cannot have width or height properties (unless changed with CSS).
    They can only contain other inline elements or text.

    Examples of Inline Elements:

        <span>

        <a>

        <strong>

        <em>

        <img>

        <button>
