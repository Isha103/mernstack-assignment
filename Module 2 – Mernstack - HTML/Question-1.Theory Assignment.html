<!-- Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development? 

HTML HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It is a markup language that defines the 
structure of web pages using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, and more. HTML documents are written using tags,
which are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <html>, <body>, <p>, etc.).

    Purpose of HTML in Web Development:
        1.Structure Content:
        HTML provides the basic structure of a webpage by defining elements like headers, paragraphs, links, and images. It gives the web content 
        an organized format so it can be easily read by browsers.

        2.Define Relationships:
        Through the use of hyperlinks, HTML allows the creation of links between different pages and resources on the web, enabling navigation and 
        interactivity.

        3.Support for Multimedia:
        HTML can embed images, audio, video, and other media, making web pages more interactive and engaging.

        4.Accessibility:
        HTML allows developers to structure content in a way that ensures it is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with 
        disabilities, by using proper semantic elements and accessibility features.

        5.Foundation for Styling and Scripting:
        HTML works alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity, creating a fully functional and 
        visually appealing website.
