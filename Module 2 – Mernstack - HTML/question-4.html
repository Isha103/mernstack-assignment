Question-4.Theory Assignment
<!--  Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO? Provide examples of semantic elements.

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning in a way that both browsers and developers can understand.
These elements convey the structure and content of a webpage in a meaningful way, making it easier to maintain, improve accessibility, and optimize
for search engines.

Importance for Accessibility:

Semantic HTML helps make websites more accessible, especially for users with disabilities who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.
By using semantic elements, you provide context to the content, allowing screen readers to interpret and convey the structure of the page more
accurately. For example, a screen reader can distinguish between a header, a paragraph, and a list, making it easier for users to navigate and 
understand the page.

Importance for SEO:

Search engines use the structure of a webpage to understand its content and relevance. When you use semantic HTML, it helps search engines
interpret the meaning of the content more clearly. For example, a <header> tag tells search engines that the content inside it is important for 
page navigation, while a <footer> tag indicates that it contains secondary information. This improves the pageâ€™s crawlability and indexability,
leading to better rankings in search results.

Examples of Semantic Elements:

1. <header>: Defines the introductory content or navigational links of a page or section.

Example:

<header>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>



2. <footer>: Contains footer content, like copyright information, contact details, or related links.

Example:

<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2025 My Website</p>
</footer>


3. <article>: Represents independent, self-contained content, often used for blog posts or news articles.

Example:

<article>
  <h2>Breaking News: New Web Design Trends in 2025</h2>
  <p>This year, web design trends focus on minimalism and user-centric experiences...</p>
</article>


4. <section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, usually with a heading.

Example:

<section>
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>We are a company that specializes in web development...</p>
</section>


5. <nav>: Defines navigation links.

Example:

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>


6. <main>: Represents the main content of a document, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars.

Example:

<main>
  <h1>Welcome to our Service Page</h1>
  <p>Here is an overview of what we offer...</p>
</main>


By using semantic elements properly, you improve the usability, readability, and SEO of a website while enhancing accessibility for all users.
