<!-- Question 1: What are HTML forms used for? Describe the purpose of the input, textarea, select, and buttonelements.  
 
HTML forms are used to collect and submit user data to a server for processing. Forms are essential for enabling
interaction on web pages, allowing users to input information, submit it, and perform various tasks such as
registering, logging in, and making purchases.

Hereâ€™s an overview of the purpose of specific form elements:

1. Input (<input>):

The <input> element is versatile and can create various types of input fields based on the type attribute.
It is used for collecting short, single-line information such as text, passwords, email addresses, checkboxes,
radio buttons, or even file uploads. For example:

type="text" for a single-line text input.

type="password" for password input fields.

type="radio" or type="checkbox" for selecting options.


2. Text Area (<textarea>):

The <textarea> element allows users to input multi-line text, such as longer comments or messages. Unlike the 
<input> element, which is single-line, the <textarea> element provides a larger area for text input. You can 
control its size by using the rows and cols attributes, which define the visible height and width of the text area.


3. Select (<select>):

The <select> element is used to create a dropdown list of options from which the user can choose. It contains
<option> elements that represent each choice. The user can select one or multiple options, depending on the 
attributes set (e.g., multiple attribute). It is useful when you want to present a list of choices in a compact form.


4. Button (<button>):

The <button> element is used to create clickable buttons in forms. It can trigger actions like submitting the form,
resetting fields, or performing JavaScript functions. The button can have various types:

type="submit" for submitting the form.

type="reset" for resetting the form to its initial state.

type="button" for custom button actions using JavaScript.
