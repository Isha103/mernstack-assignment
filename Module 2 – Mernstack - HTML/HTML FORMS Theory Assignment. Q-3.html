<!--  Question 3: What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve 
accessibility?

The <label> element in a form is used to define a user-readable description for form controls such as input fields,
checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. It improves accessibility by ensuring that users, especially those relying 
on screen readers or assistive technologies, can easily identify the purpose of each form control.

    Here's how it enhances accessibility:

    1. Associates text with form controls: The <label> element explicitly associates descriptive text with a
    specific form input. This is done using the for attribute, which links the label to the corresponding input
    element by its id. This association helps users, especially those with visual impairments, understand what
    information is required for each form field.

    2. Improves keyboard navigation: When users navigate through a form using a keyboard, they can focus on the
    label text, making it clear which input field they are interacting with. This makes the form more intuitive
    for users who may not use a mouse.

    3. Supports screen readers: Screen readers announce the label text when users focus on the associated form 
    allowing users with visual impairments to know what type of data they should input.

    4. Increases clickable area: The clickable area of the form control is extended to the label itself. This is 
    especially useful for smaller input elements, like checkboxes or radio buttons, making them easier to interact
    with.
